# Scene selection

<div align="justify">

For the qualitative evaluation, 5 different categories of scenes were selected, which are characterized by unfavorable detection conditions.
* The first category of scenes concerns **ships with extreme ship sizes** and was selected to evaluate the ability of networks to detect objects at different spatial scales.
* The second category of scenes includes **ships that are located at very short distances from each other** and was selected in order to evaluate the different bounding box mechanisms of the networks.
* The other categories of images concern scenes in which are depicted: a)**noise artifacts**, b)**land sections with very high radiometric values** and c)**small islets**. The above 3 categories of scenes were selected to examine the robustness of each model to radiometric patterns which potentially resemble those of ships.
